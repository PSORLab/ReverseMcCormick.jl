ReverseMcCormick.jl is a component package in the EAGO ecosystem and is reexported by [EAGO.jl](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl). It contains a library of reverse nonsmooth and differentiable McCormick updates. Documentation for this is included in the [EAGO.jl](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl) package and additional usage examples are included [EAGO-notebooks](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO-notebooks) in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
